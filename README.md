# GroceryStoreItemLocator
Web Based Application that will assist users in finding an item in a grocery store. The database will need to be large, but could be helpful if it got to that point.

The app should not need much to run. As of now it needs to be ran through the server because the Database file was created there. In the future it should be placed in an environment variable. The database needs to be installed because it has data for the current store. Eventually this should be put on postgreSQL.

The basic functions of the applications are:
Search Store - use store code, 10121. It is the only store so far.
Search Items by name
Add items to a list
Show the map
